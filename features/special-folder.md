Some folders are considered special. Once a they have been created (or renamed into) they will be flagged automatically and assigned the `folder_special` icon so they stand out from the others.

Special folders are locked. In the sense they cannot be deleted nor renamed once they are flagged.

Such actions will not be applied and will instead trigger a warning.
