# ðŸš€ File Upload

The file manager uses Firebase free plan to handle file storage.

Using the Storage service, we are able to save different files on the cloud.

Once a file is uploaded, a URL is provided by Firebase which could be used to download that resource.

The local db has the entity's name, URL, parent and other useful properties.
